        <p>Yoriichi Tsugikuni is one of the strongest demon slayers in <span class="sim">Kimetsu no Yaiba series</span>. He has a twin brother named <span class="sim">Michikatsu Tsugikuni</span>. Their parents are kind of double standard where their parents love Michikatsu more. In the world full of demon swarming around, Yoriichi was <span class="sim">destined to defeat the demon king</span> so that all of them will die. He possessed the strongest breathing technique called "the sun breathing" which is the most effective technique to kill demon. </p>
