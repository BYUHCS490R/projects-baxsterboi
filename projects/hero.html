        <p>Yoriichi Tsugikuni is one of the strongest demon slayers in Kimetsu no Yaiba series. He has a twin brother named Michikatsu Tsugikuni. Their parents are kind of double standard where their parents love Michikatsu more. In the world full of demon swarming around, Yoriichi was destined to defeat the demon king so that all of them will die. He possessed the strongest breathing technique called "the sun breathing" which is the most effective technique to kill demon. </p>
