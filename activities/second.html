    <h1>Engagement -  Git and Github help</h1>
    <p>1. Ask Professor Slade in class and reach out to tutor in P2 outside of class</p>
    <p>2. Engagement assignments due at 11.59pm. These assignments can't be turned late. Grade will be deducted if we miss one. </p>
    <p>3. Project assignments usually due 11.59pm but professor will extend it till 5am to give us chance. Same as engagement assignments, the grade will be deducted.
    <p>4. The link can't be use because it is our personal link or things that we did on visual code. </p>
